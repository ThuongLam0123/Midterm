<p>Name of the instructor: Adam Brehm </p>
<p>Before taking this class, I do not know how to create a website even the easy one. This makes me hard to achieve the dream of create a small website to keep my family memories and growing up process of my kids.</p>
<p>AFter this class, I believe I can create a website (html) with beautiful font (CSS) to keep my family journey and moments on the web.</p>
