<h1>A proud person from a multicutural family</h1>
<p>
I am first taking this Website Development class which inspires me to create a beautiful blog for my kids in the future. </p>
<p>I hope that I can learn some basic knowledge in this class for my future career. This class is first step that help me to reach AA degree in IS- Business Software.</p>
