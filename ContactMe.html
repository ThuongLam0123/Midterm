<h1>Contact Thuong</h1>
<p>
Please contact me through the below email and address.
</p>

<p>page must have a form that collects the user's name, a subject for the message and an area to enter additional information from the user. Once the form is submitted, a Thank you page should be shown: NAME, EMAIL, COMMENTS AND THEN THANK YOU</p>

<p>NOTE:  We are not doing SERVER-SIDE scripting, but just simulating how to send the data to the server.  The way this work is by using the attribute action in your <form>:

<form action="name-of-your-thankyou-page.html" method="get"
name="myContact">

...

</form></p>
</body>
</html>
